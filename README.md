Documentation from various services, Enjoy an offline copy

# 📚 Random-Docs

This repository contains offline copies of documentation from various tools, services, and platforms I regularly use.

Most of these sites don't offer downloadable documentation, so I built a custom crawler to fetch, clean, and interlink everything locally — think Obsidian-style backlinks, no tracking, and no fluff.

If you're here, enjoy the convenience. No guarantees on completeness, but it's better than hitting 404s when a site goes down.

It's a work in progress but until polished it is free (later when complete $20 a year so grab it now if you are okay with mostly functional jank) https://github.com/Detin-tech/Doc-grabber
